    "There are various ways to install your MySQL database locally on your computer. The easiest way is using a Docker. We will be using this approach.\n",

    "Before you can deploy a docker image you need to install docker: \n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have docker installed, you can download the docker image for a MySQL database. Clone this git repository to a folder you wish (I use my Documents folder generally):\n",

    "\n",
    "After cloning the repository, navigate (via your Terminal) into the slim folder within the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd mysql-docker/slim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then compose the docker image using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo docker-compose up -d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-d` ensures that the docker image is run in the background. Otherwise it will run in your current Terminal session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your MySQL instance should be running locally on your computer. If you open the dashboard of your Docker Desktop, you should see something like this: \n",
